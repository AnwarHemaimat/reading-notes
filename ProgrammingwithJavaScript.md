### Before you learn how to read and write the JavaScript language itself, you need to become familiar with some key concepts in computer programming. They will be covered in three sections:

A  
What is a script and how do I create one?
B

## Expressions
In general, an expression is a snippet of code that evaluates to a value. A statement is a snippet of code that performs an action. Wherever JavaScript expects a statement, you can write an expression. But the opposite isn't true: if a framework or the JavaScript runtime expects an expression, you cannot use a statement.

## Operators
JavaScript includes operators as in other languages. An operator performs some operation on single or multiple operands (data value) and produces a result. For example 1 + 2, where + sign is an operator and 1 is left operand and 2 is right operand. + operator adds two numeric values and produces a result which is 3 in this case.
