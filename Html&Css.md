## Do you know what is the meaning of Website?
is a collection of web pages and related content that is identified by a common domain name and published on at least one web server.

## So, Why People Visit YOUR Website?
Here we have a three reasons :   
1. They are looking for information.   
2. They want to contact you.   
3. They want to transact with you.   

## About the information which are the users need it from your website:
When people browse a website, they want easy navigation, attractive design, and relevant content.

## How Often People Will Visit Your Site?
Working out how often people
are likely to revisit your site gives
you an indication for how often
you should update the site.  
It can often be helpful to set a
schedule for when a site will be
updated (rather than doing it on
an ad hoc basis).   

## Getting your message across using design
The primary aim of any kind of visual design
is to communicate. Organizing and prioritizing
information on a page helps users understand
its importance and what order to read it in.

## Designing Navigation
Site navigation not only helps people find where they want to go, but also
helps them understand what your site is about and how it is organized.
Good navigation tends to follow these principles:
* Concise .  
* Clear  . 
* Selective .
* Context  .
* Interactive  .
* Consistent  .

## What Markup does?
 is the difference between the market price of a security personally held by a broker-dealer and the price paid by a customer.   

 ## How to check HTML version of any website?
 To check HTML version of a website or web application you can simply check the source code  of the site (normally  CTR+U ) and look at the Doctype on top any other code.  

 ## Identification and grouping of elements:
 ### Identification
We use class or id to find or select HTML elements to apply the required styles.

The advantage of using selectors is that we can present the same element differently depending on its class or id.

# HTML5 Layout

## HTML5 layout elements
 HTML has several semantic elements that define the different parts of a web page: HTML5 Semantic Elements.  
 
 The elements which are helpful in creating layouts are :
* header

* nav

* section

* article

* aside

* footer

* details

* summary  

## How old browsers understand new elements?
Older browsers that do not understand HTML5
elements need to be told which elements are
block-level elements.
