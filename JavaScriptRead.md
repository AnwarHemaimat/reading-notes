## HTML 
Starting with the HTML layer
allows you to focus on the most
important thing about your site:
its content.
Being plain HTML, this layer
should work on all kinds of
devices, be accessible to all
users, and load quite quickly on
slow connections. 

## HTML && CSS
Adding the CSS rules in a
separate file keeps rules
regarding how the page looks
away from the content itself.
You can use the same style sheet
with all of your site, making your
sites faster to load and easier
to maintain. Or you can use
different style sheets with the
same content to create different
views of the same data. 

## HTML && CSS && JAVASCRIPT
The JavaScript is added last
and enhances the usability of
the page or the experience of
interacting with the site.
Keeping it separate means
that the page still works if the
user cannot load or run the
JavaScript. You can also reuse
the code on several pages
(making the site faster to load
and easier to maintain).

  ##  how it will fit together with the HTML and CSS in your web pages?
  You can add JavaScript code in an HTML document by employing the dedicated HTML "tag script tag " that wraps around JavaScript code.    
  The "tag script tag" can be placed in the "tag head tag" section of your HTML, in the "tag body tag" section, or after the closing tag of body, depending on when you want the JavaScript to load.

# What does script mean in HTML?
 The HTML "tag script tag" element is used to embed executable code or data; this is typically used to embed or refer to JavaScript code. The "tag script tag" element can also be used with other languages, such as WebGL's GLSL shader programming language and JSON.
